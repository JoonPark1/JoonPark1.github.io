            Below, I have attached a demo of drawing geometrical shapes, lines, 
            bitmaps, and more! In order for this to be possible, the device driver
            software had to communicate to the hardware device and relay responses
            back to the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) in a timely manner!

            <p>1. In order to transition from one drawing to another drawing, the screen
            needs to get flushed on a consistent basis. The flush request has to be 
            effectively carried out by hardware and GPU must be alerted before
            drawing a new thing.</span>
            <p>2.The data for each and every pixel is stored in a framebuffer 
            data structure and have to be consistently updated and kept in align
            with the state object that keeps track of the state of the device
            driver.</span>
