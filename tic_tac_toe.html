            Below, I have attached a demo video playing 2 example rounds of tic
            tac toe game! I hope you enjoy the demo. Also, if you are confused
            about positioning of cells, make sure to read the description
            section on home page!

                    <p>1. The player can only place on an empty cell!</p>
                    <p>2. The player can win if he gets 3 of his marks without getting blocked.</p>
                    <p>3. If no player wins and all cells are full, the game results in a tie!</p>
